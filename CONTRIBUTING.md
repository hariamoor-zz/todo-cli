Why is all the documentation in Org?
====================================

Because I had Emacs open at the time of writing it. I wouldn\'t mind a
PR to `pandoc` everything to Markdown as of now, but you\'d need to
manually verify that it\'s valid [Github-flavored
Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/).
