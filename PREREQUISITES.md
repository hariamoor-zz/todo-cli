How do I know if I\'m ready to learn Rust?
==========================================

Some people argue that [Rust is a difficult
language](https://vorner.github.io/difficult.html) because of its
differences from mainstream languages, while others believe those same
differences make it easier to learn. Whatever the case, it remains that,
for an engineer to use Rust to its fullest extent, s/he must learn
several other concepts:

-   Memory management at compile-time, i.e. in C/C++
    -   Ideally with C++ STL abstractions - the Rust borrow checker is
        very similar
-   Basic type theory for metaprogramming - a big part of Rust
    -   Algebraic data types
    -   Higher-kinded types
-   Basic functional programming
-   Concurrency/parallelism (ideal to have, but not necessary)

This is by no means a hard-and-fast prerequisite list; they are just
concepts in software and computer science that make Rust a lot easier to
learn. The easiest way to get started is read [the Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ "This tutorial is dense in links to this wonderful role model of documentation.").

In Rutgers CS terms, this roughly equates to a background comprised of
Systems Programming (214) and Principles of Programming Langugages
(314).
