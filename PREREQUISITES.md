How do I know if I\'m ready to learn Rust?
==========================================

Some people argue that [Rust is a difficult
language](https://vorner.github.io/difficult.html) because of its
differences from mainstream languages, while others believe those same
differences make it easier to learn. Whatever the case, it remains that,
before an engineer can use Rust to its fullest extent, s/he must learn
several other concepts:

-   Memory management at compile-time, i.e. in C/C++
    -   Ideally with C++ STL abstractions - the Rust borrow checker is
        very similar
-   Basic type theory for metaprogramming - a big part of Rust
    -   Algebraic data types
    -   Higher-kinded types
-   Basic functional programming
-   Concurrency/parallelism (ideal to have, but not necessary)

This is by no means a hard-and-fast prerequisite list; they are just
concepts in software and computer science that make Rust a lot easier to
learn.

In Rutgers CS terms, this roughly equates to a background comprised of
Systems Programming (214) and Principles of Programming Langugages
(314).
