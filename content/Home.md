Welcome to the todo-cli wiki!

Here, we will track the work we did each week in separate articles.

There are also (a lot of) asides in each week. These have two forms, serving different purposes:

- The asides that explain more of Rust. If we were to explain all of the syntax mid-stream, the tutorials
  would be harder to follow, so we simply have asides with more details about syntax and set-up (and links
  to better documentation).
- The asides that evangelize the better aspects of Rust programming or functional programming or other profoundly
  nerdy bits we'd like to (over-)share.

A few promises: we will link to external docs as needed and we will link to and from all asides so that you can find
your place in the tutorial even if you follow us along every tangent.
